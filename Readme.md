1. build new model, and perform the following tasks
2. 3) Set the inter arrival time of [raw_material] object asfollows: Normal distribution with mean 5 and standard deviation 1.5
3. 4) Set the process times of [machine1], [machine2],[machine3] objects as followsMachine1 : 5 secondsMachine2 : 7 secondsMachine3 : 2 seconds
4. Guess which Queue object ([wait1], [wait2] and [wait3]) has the longest waiting time, and which one has the shortest waiting time
5. Set Run Time = 1,000
6. Run the model and check if your answers are correct
